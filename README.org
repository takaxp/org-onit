* Introduction

This package provides automated ~org-clock-in~ and ~org-clock-out~ by adding ~Doing~ tag to a heading of an org mode buffer. While the ~Doing~ tag appears in an org buffer, Emacs Org mode maintains the task clocking.

You can say "I'm on it!".

[[https://github.com/takaxp/contents/blob/master/org-onit/org-onit-toggle-doing.png]]

* Install

Please put ~org-onit.el~ into your =load-path=.

If you use ~package.el~ or other package manager, no necessary to add =(require 'org-onit)= to your ~init.el~ and just call toggle commands =org-onit-toggle-doing= or =org-onit-toggle-auto= in an org buffer.

** Additional package

It is recommended to install [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-bookmark-heading][org-bookmark-heading]] because a normal jump by built-in ~bookmark.el~ is not sufficiently accurate for org buffers. [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-bookmark-heading][org-bookmark-heading]] provides more precise jumping capability by adding ID property to each org mode heading. ~org-onit.el~ will use [[https://github.com/alphapapa/org-bookmark-heading][org-bookmark-heading]] if available but not mandatory.

* Recommend settings
** Highly recommended

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load "org-clock"
  (setq org-clock-out-remove-zero-time-clocks t))
#+end_src

** Recommended keybindings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(with-eval-after-load "org"
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-<f11>") 'org-clock-goto)
  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "<f11>") 'org-onit-toggle-doing)

  (define-key org-mode-map (kbd "S-<f11>") 'org-onit-goto-anchor))
#+end_src

** Optional settings

You can freely arrange =org-clock-frame-title-format=. If you install [[https://github.com/mallt/org-clock-today-mode][org-clock-toay.el]] in your system, then you can show a working time only for today.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp

* How to use
** Manual approach

If you apply the above recommended keybindings, then just type =<f11>= in an org buffer. A tag of a heading having the cursor will be changed to =Doing= and automatically start to =org-clock-in=. You can go any buffers and do anything but you can go back to the =Doing= tagged heading by just typing =C-<f11>=. Typing =<f11>= again, then =org-clock-out= is executed and =Doing= tag will disappear. When you type =S-<f11>=, you can go back to the original position you are jumped from.

*** clock-in and clock-out triggers
**** clock-in triggers

=org-clock-in= will be called when:

- calling =org-onit-toggle-doing= if the task is not ~DONE~
- calling =org-onit-toggle-doing= at any headings if =:wakeup= of =org-onit-basic-options= is =doing= or =both=
- unfolding a heading if =:unfold= of =org-onit-basic-options= is non-nil

**** clock-out triggers

=org-clock-out= will be called when:

- calling =org-onit-toggle-doing=
- making the task ~DONE~ or removing todo state

** Automated approach

Use =M-x org-onit-toggle-auto=. Toggling =org-clock-in= and =org-clock-out= will be done automatically no need to toggle =Doing= tag by yourself.

*** clock-in and clock-out triggers

**** clock-in triggers

=org-clock-in= will be called when:

- visiting a heading if the task is not ~DONE~
- visiting a heading if =:nostate= of =org-onit-basic-options= is =auto= or =both= and the task is not ~DONE~
- making the task not ~DONE~

**** clock-out triggers

=org-clock-out= will be called when:

- switching to other headings if the task has a todo state (e.g. ~TODO~)
- switching to other headings if =:nostate= of =org-onit-basic-options== is =auto= or =both= and the task is not ~DONE~
- making the task ~DONE~
- calling =org-onit-toggle-doing=

** Options
 - org-onit-wakeup-done (~deprecated~, use =org-onit-basic-options=)
   - Allow switching to =org-clock-in= by =org-onit-toggle-doing= when the heading is DONE.
   - Default: nil
 - org-onit-include-no-state-heading (~deprecated~, use =org-onit-basic-options=)
   - Allow switching to =org-clock-in= in any headings except headings in TODO when =org-onit-toggle-auto= is used
   - Default: nil
 - org-onit-basic-options
   - This variable is buffer-local. Please use =setq-default= or =custom-set-variables= in your init.el.
   - =:wakeup= allows switching to =org-clock-in= when the heading is DONE.
   - =:nostate= allows switching to =org-clock-in= in any headings except headings in TODO
   - =:unfold= allows switching to =org-clock-in= when unfolding a heading
   - Default: (=:wakeup= nil =:nostate= nil =:unfold= nil)
     - =:wakeup= and =:nostate= can take =doing=, =auto=, =both=, and =nil=
       - If =doing= is specified, the option will be used in =org-onit-toggle-doing=
       - If =auto= is specified, the option will be used in =org-onit-toggle-auto=
       - If =both= is specified, the option will be used in =org-onit-toggle-doing= and =org-onit-toggle-auto=
     - =:unfold= can take =t= or =nil=
       - But =:wakeup= and =:nostate= are given priority over =:unfold=
 - org-onit-encure-clock-out-when-exit
   - Call =org-clock-out= when killing Emacs if =org-clock-persis= is not =history= or =nil=
   - Default: t
 - org-onit-keep-no-state
   - If non-nil, allow clocking in but keep the heading TODO state none
   - If nil and =:nostate= of =org-onit-basic-options= is specified as non-nil, then the subtree will be changed to TODO heading state and clock-in
   - Default: t
